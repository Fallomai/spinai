SpinAI now supports multiple LLMs for agent decision making, expanding our offerings to include:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai)
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic)
- [Cloudflare](/llms/cloudflare) {/* New */}
- [HTTP-based LLM](/llms/http) {/* New */}

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings like:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## Choosing an LLM

Consider these factors when choosing an LLM:

- Cost per token
- Response quality
- API reliability
- Token context limits

## Introducing Cloudflare and HTTP-based LLMs

SpinAI has expanded its LLM support to include Cloudflare and custom HTTP-based LLMs, allowing for more flexibility and customization in integrating language models into your applications.

### Cloudflare

The Cloudflare LLM offers a secure and scalable way to access powerful language models. It is particularly suited for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.

### HTTP-based LLM

Our HTTP-based LLM support enables you to integrate any language model that can be accessed over HTTP. This option provides maximum flexibility, allowing you to use proprietary models or other third-party models not directly supported by SpinAI.
