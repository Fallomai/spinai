SpinAI supports multiple LLMs for agent decision making:

- [OpenAI](/llms/openai)
- [Anthropic](/llms/anthropic)
- [Gemini](/llms/gemini)

Each LLM can be configured with custom settings like:

- Model selection
- Temperature
- Token limits
- API configuration

## Choosing an LLM

Consider these factors when choosing an LLM:

- Cost per token
- Response quality
- API reliability
- Token context limits

## Available Models

SpinAI has recently added support for the Gemini model, a powerful and flexible option for various applications. Gemini is designed to offer high-quality responses with an emphasis on reliability and cost-efficiency. For detailed setup and configuration instructions, refer to the [Gemini documentation](/llms/gemini).
