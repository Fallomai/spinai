SpinAI 2.0 and later now supports models all models available via the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) by Vercel. This includes more than 10 different models from multiple providers. Please refer to their [documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for more information.

Note, the AI SDK imports your API keys from environment variables, so you will need to set them in your `.env`.

## Usage

#### OpenAI example:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const agent = createAgent({
  instructions: "Help users with support tickets",
  actions: [getCustomerInfo, createTicket],
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});

const { response } = await agent({
  input: "I want a refund",
});
```
