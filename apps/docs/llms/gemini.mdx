## Introduction

Google's Gemini model represents a significant advancement in the field of generative AI, offering unparalleled capabilities for natural language understanding and generation. The SpinAI package now supports integration with the Gemini model, enabling developers to leverage its capabilities for a wide range of applications, from automated content creation to sophisticated conversational agents.

## Setup and Configuration

To begin using the Gemini model within your SpinAI projects, you'll first need to configure the model with your API key and optionally specify the model version you wish to use.

```typescript
import { createGeminiLLM } from "spinai";

const geminiLLM = createGeminiLLM({
  apiKey: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY, // Your Google API key
  model: "gemini-2.0-flash", // Optional, defaults to gemini-2.0-flash
});
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
interface GeminiConfig {
  apiKey: string; // Your Google API key is required
  model?: string; // Model version, optional
}
```

## Example Usage

Integrating the Gemini model into your project is straightforward. Here's a basic example demonstrating how to generate content based on a prompt.

```typescript
async function generateContent() {
  const content = await geminiLLM.complete({
    prompt: "Write a brief introduction to the Gemini model.",
    maxTokens: 256,
  });

  console.log(content);
}
```

### Advanced Configuration Example

For more advanced use cases, you can customize the generation process by specifying additional options such as `temperature` and `maxTokens`, which control the creativity of the responses and the maximum length of the generated content, respectively.

```typescript
async function generateAdvancedContent() {
  const content = await geminiLLM.complete({
    prompt: "Explain the benefits of using generative AI in healthcare.",
    temperature: 0.9,
    maxTokens: 512,
  });

  console.log(content);
}
```

## Best Practices

- **API Key Security**: Ensure your API key is securely stored and not hard-coded directly into your application's source code.
- **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of Google's API rate limits to avoid service interruptions.
- **Content Moderation**: Always implement content moderation when generating content for public consumption to ensure it adheres to community guidelines and standards.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: If you encounter authentication errors, double-check your API key and ensure it has not expired.
- **Model Responses**: For unexpected model responses, consider adjusting the `temperature` and `maxTokens` parameters to fine-tune the generative output.
- **Rate Limiting**: Should you hit rate limits, review your usage patterns and consider implementing caching or request throttling as necessary.
