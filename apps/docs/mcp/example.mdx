In this guide, we'll create a simple GitHub assistant that can help manage repositories using MCP actions. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a SpinAI project with MCP integration
- Configure GitHub actions through MCP
- Create an agent that can interact with GitHub's API
- Test your agent with a basic repository creation task

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New SpinAI Project

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

When prompted, select the default template. This will set up a basic SpinAI project structure for us to build upon.

> 💡 **Quick Start**: If you want to skip the manual setup, you can select the `GitHub MCP Agent` template instead of the default template. **This will automatically configure everything we'll cover in steps 1-5, and you can jump straight to running the agent (don't forget to setup your environment variables, though!).**

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

You'll need:

1. An OpenAI API key for running the agent. We're using OpenAI's model in this example, but you can swap it for any model supported by [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).

2. A GitHub personal access token. To create one:
   - Go to GitHub's [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "SpinAI GitHub Assistant")
   - Select only the permissions you're comfortable with. For this example, you'll need:
     - `repo` access to create and manage repositories
     - `read:user` for basic profile information
   - Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again!)
   - Paste it into your `.env` file as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It should belisted in your `.gitignore`, but in case it's not, make sure it is.

### 3. Set Up MCP Configuration

You'll need to create an MCP configuration file to specify which MCP actions you want to use. There are two ways to do this:

The easiest way is to use our CLI tool:

```bash
npx spinai-mcp install @smithery-ai/github --provider smithery --config "{\"githubPersonalAccessToken\":\"move_my_token_to_a_dot_env_after\"}"
```

This command will automatically create or update your `mcp-config.ts` file with the GitHub MCP configuration.

**NOTE:** It's highly recommended to keep your GITHUB_TOKEN in your `.env` and either import it in your mcp-config.ts, or in the next step.

### 4. Set Up the Agent

Now we'll set up our agent to use the MCP actions. Open your `src/index.ts` file and replace the boilerplate code with:

```typescript
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
// @ts-ignore
import mcpConfig from "../mcp-config.ts";

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Create actions from MCP configuration
  console.log("Setting up MCP actions...");
  const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig({
    config: mcpConfig,
    // if you didn't include your GITHUB_TOKEN in your mcp-config.ts
    envMapping: {
      githubPersonalAccessToken: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
    },
    // If there are any actions you would like to exclude. A full list of actions can be found at https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github
    excludedActions: ["smithery_ai_github_get_issue"],
  });

  const agent = createAgent({
    instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
    Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
    actions: [...mcpActions],
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  });

  // Run the agent with a test command
  const { response } = await agent({
    input: "Create a github repo called 'GlubGlub' please",
  });

  console.log("Response:", response);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Let's break down what's happening:

1. We import the necessary functions from SpinAI and the OpenAI model from AI SDK
2. `createActionsFromMcpConfig` translates our MCP configuration into SpinAI actions
3. We create an agent with those actions and instructions about its purpose
4. Finally, we run the agent with a test command to create a repository

### 5. Run the Agent

Now you can run your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can modify the `input` in your code to make the agent perform different GitHub tasks. For example:

```typescript
// Create a new repository
input: "Create a github repo called 'GlubGlub' please";

// Create an issue in an existing repository
input: "Create an issue in my repository about adding documentation";

// Search for repositories
input: "Find repositories related to machine learning";
```

The agent will use the appropriate GitHub MCP actions based on your requests.

## Optional Next Steps

### 6. Deploy as an API Endpoint

If you want to use your GitHub assistant as a workflow endpoint, you can wrap it in a web server. Here's a quick example using Hono:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import mcpConfig from "./mcp-config.ts";
// your dotenv config and other stuff here

const app = new Hono();
const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig(mcpConfig);

const agent = createAgent({
  instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
  Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
  actions: [...mcpActions],
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});

app.post("/github-assistant", async (c) => {
  const { input } = await c.req.tson();
  const { response } = await agent({ input });
  return c.tson({ response });
});

export default app;
```

### 7. Create an Interactive Chat Loop

For a more interactive experience, you can create a chat loop that maintains conversation history:

```typescript
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as readline from "readline";
// @ts-ignore
import mcpConfig from "../mcp-config.ts";

dotenv.config();

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

async function chat() {
  console.log("Setting up...");
  const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig(mcpConfig);
  console.log("\n🤖 Ready! Type your message (or 'exit' to quit)\n");

  const agent = createAgent({
    instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
    Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
    actions: [...mcpActions],
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  });

  let messageHistory: any[] = [];

  function getInput() {
    rl.question("> ", async (input) => {
      if (input.toLowerCase() === "exit") {
        rl.close();
        return;
      }

      try {
        const { messages, response } = await agent({
          input,
          messages: messageHistory,
        });

        // Update message history
        messageHistory = messages;

        // Show any tool calls
        const toolCalls = messages.filter((m) => m.role === "tool");
        if (toolCalls.length > 0) {
          console.log("\nActions:");
          toolCalls.forEach((call) => {
            console.log(`• ${call.content[0].toolName}`);
          });
          console.log();
        }

        console.log(`Assistant: ${response}\n`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("\nError:", error, "\n");
      }

      getInput();
    });
  }

  getInput();
}

chat().catch(console.error);

// Handle clean exit
rl.on("close", () => {
  console.log("\nGoodbye!");
  process.exit(0);
});
```

This creates an interactive CLI where you can have ongoing conversations with your GitHub assistant while maintaining context.

### 8. Add a UI (Coming Soon!)

Want to turn your GitHub assistant into a full-fledged chat application with a beautiful UI? We're working on making this seamless with a one-line integration. Stay tuned for updates!

In the meantime, you can build your own UI using your preferred frontend framework and connect it to either the API endpoint from step 7 or adapt the chat logic from step 8.
