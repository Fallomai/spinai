# Using MCP Actions in SpinAI

SpinAI's integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows you to seamlessly incorporate powerful platform actions into your AI agents. MCP actions work just like regular SpinAI actions, and can be composed with other actions in your agent's toolkit.

This is extremely powerful because it has the potential to give your AI agents a whole toolbox of actions without writing any code yourself.

## Let's build an example

In this guide, we'll create a simple GitHub assistant that can help manage repositories using MCP actions. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a SpinAI project with MCP integration
- Configure GitHub actions through MCP
- Create an agent that can interact with GitHub's API
- Test your agent with a basic repository creation task

You can follow this guide step-by-step to understand how everything works, or if you prefer, you can jump right in by running:

```bash
npm create spinai
```

and selecting the `GitHub MCP Agent` template, which will set up everything for you automatically.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New SpinAI Project

If you're following the step-by-step guide, create a new SpinAI project using the default template:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

When prompted, select the default template. This will set up a basic SpinAI project structure for us to build upon.

> 💡 **Quick Start**: If you want to skip the manual setup, you can select the `GitHub MCP Agent` template instead of the default template. This will automatically configure everything we'll cover in steps 1-5, and you can jump straight to step 6!

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

You'll need:

1. An OpenAI API key for running the agent. We're using OpenAI's model in this example, but you can swap it for any model supported by [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).

2. A GitHub personal access token. To create one:
   - Go to GitHub's [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "SpinAI GitHub Assistant")
   - Select only the permissions you're comfortable with. For this example, you'll need:
     - `repo` access to create and manage repositories
     - `read:user` for basic profile information
   - Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again!)
   - Paste it into your `.env` file as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value

⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It should belisted in your `.gitignore`, but in case it's not, make sure it is.

### 3. Set Up MCP Configuration

You'll need to create an MCP configuration file to specify which MCP actions you want to use. There are two ways to do this:

#### Option A: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way is to use our CLI tool:

```bash
npx spinai-mcp install @smithery-ai/github
```

This command will automatically create or update your `mcp-config.js` file with the GitHub MCP configuration.

#### Option B: Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can create the `mcp-config.js` file manually in your project root:

```javascript
export default {
  smithery_ai_github: {
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@smithery/cli@latest", "run", "@smithery-ai/github"],
    envMapping: {
      GITHUB_TOKEN: "githubPersonalAccessToken",
    },
  },
};
```

Both methods will set up the necessary configuration to use GitHub MCP actions in your SpinAI agent. The configuration tells SpinAI how to load and execute the GitHub-related actions provided by the Smithery AI GitHub MCP.

### 4. Update Environment Mapping

Now you'll need to update the `envMapping` in your `mcp-config.js`. The GitHub MCP expects a variable called `githubPersonalAccessToken`, but we've set up our environment variable as `GITHUB_TOKEN`. We need to map between them:

1. Open your `mcp-config.js` file
2. Locate the `envMapping` object
3. Update it to map our environment variable to the expected MCP variable:

```javascript
envMapping: {
  GITHUB_TOKEN: "githubPersonalAccessToken",
},
```

This mapping tells the MCP to use the value from our `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable when it needs the `githubPersonalAccessToken`.

### 5. Set Up the Agent

Now we'll set up our agent to use the MCP actions. Open your `src/index.ts` file and replace the boilerplate code with:

```typescript
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
// @ts-ignore
import mcpConfig from "../mcp-config.js";

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Create actions from MCP configuration
  console.log("Setting up MCP actions...");
  const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig(mcpConfig);

  const agent = createAgent({
    instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
    Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
    actions: [...mcpActions],
    model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  });

  // Run the agent with a test command
  const { response } = await agent({
    input: "Create a github repo called 'GlubGlub' please",
  });

  console.log("Response:", response);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Let's break down what's happening:

1. We import the necessary functions from SpinAI and the OpenAI model from AI SDK
2. `createActionsFromMcpConfig` translates our MCP configuration into SpinAI actions
3. We create an agent with those actions and instructions about its purpose
4. Finally, we run the agent with a test command to create a repository

### 6. Run the Agent

Now you can run your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can modify the `input` in your code to make the agent perform different GitHub tasks. For example:

```typescript
// Create a new repository
input: "Create a github repo called 'GlubGlub' please";

// Create an issue in an existing repository
input: "Create an issue in my repository about adding documentation";

// Search for repositories
input: "Find repositories related to machine learning";
```

The agent will use the appropriate GitHub MCP actions based on your requests.

## Optional Next Steps

### 7. Deploy as an API Endpoint

If you want to use your GitHub assistant as a workflow endpoint, you can wrap it in a web server. Here's a quick example using Hono:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import mcpConfig from "./mcp-config.js";
// your dotenv config and other stuff here

const app = new Hono();
const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig(mcpConfig);

const agent = createAgent({
  instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
  Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
  actions: [...mcpActions],
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});

app.post("/github-assistant", async (c) => {
  const { input } = await c.req.json();
  const { response } = await agent({ input });
  return c.json({ response });
});

export default app;
```

### 8. Create an Interactive Chat Loop

For a more interactive experience, you can create a chat loop that maintains conversation history:

```typescript
import { createAgent, createActionsFromMcpConfig } from "spinai";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as readline from "readline";
// @ts-ignore
import mcpConfig from "../mcp-config.js";

dotenv.config();

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

async function chat() {
  console.log("Setting up...");
  const mcpActions = await createActionsFromMcpConfig(mcpConfig);
  console.log("\n🤖 Ready! Type your message (or 'exit' to quit)\n");

  const agent = createAgent({
    instructions: `You are a GitHub assistant that can help with repository management.
    Use the available GitHub actions to help users with their requests.`,
    actions: [...mcpActions],
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  });

  let messageHistory: any[] = [];

  function getInput() {
    rl.question("> ", async (input) => {
      if (input.toLowerCase() === "exit") {
        rl.close();
        return;
      }

      try {
        const { messages, response } = await agent({
          input,
          messages: messageHistory,
        });

        // Update message history
        messageHistory = messages;

        // Show any tool calls
        const toolCalls = messages.filter((m) => m.role === "tool");
        if (toolCalls.length > 0) {
          console.log("\nActions:");
          toolCalls.forEach((call) => {
            console.log(`• ${call.content[0].toolName}`);
          });
          console.log();
        }

        console.log(`Assistant: ${response}\n`);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("\nError:", error, "\n");
      }

      getInput();
    });
  }

  getInput();
}

chat().catch(console.error);

// Handle clean exit
rl.on("close", () => {
  console.log("\nGoodbye!");
  process.exit(0);
});
```

This creates an interactive CLI where you can have ongoing conversations with your GitHub assistant while maintaining context.

### 9. Add a UI (Coming Soon!)

Want to turn your GitHub assistant into a full-fledged chat application with a beautiful UI? We're working on making this seamless with a one-line integration. Stay tuned for updates!

In the meantime, you can build your own UI using your preferred frontend framework and connect it to either the API endpoint from step 7 or adapt the chat logic from step 8.
