## What is SpinAI?

SpinAI is a lightweight TypeScript framework for building AI agents that can:

- Execute actions in a specific order
- Maintain state between actions
- Make decisions using any LLM
- Handle complex dependencies
- Maintain observability of the agent's state, actions, and decision making throughout the agent's lifecycle.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

An agent is a self-contained, stateful entity that:

- Receives user input
- Decides which actions to take / which tools to call
- Maintains state between actions
- Provides text or custom JSON responses back to the user
- Can use any LLM supported by Vercel's AI SDK for decision making

```typescript
const calculatorAgent = createAgent({
  instructions: `You are a calculator agent that helps users perform mathematical calculations.`,
  actions: [sum, minus],
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});
```

### Actions

Actions are functions / tools that your agent can call.

- Have clear inputs and outputs
- Maintain and access state through context
- Can depend on other actions
- Are executed in DAG (directed acyclic graph) order

```typescript
export const sum = createAction({
  id: "sum",
  description: "Adds two numbers together.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      a: { type: "number", description: "First number to add" },
      b: { type: "number", description: "Second number to add" },
    },
    required: ["a", "b"],
  },
  async run({ parameters }): Promise<number> {
    const { a, b } = parameters || {};
    return a + b;
  },
});
```
