## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

## Choose a template, and configure your .env (read the README of the template you choose)

Usually you'll need at minimum a `.env` file with your LLM's api key (OPENAI_API_KEY by default).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your agent will now:

1. Receive the user's question
2. Decide to use the getWeather action
3. Execute the action
4. Provide a response
