## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

## Choose a template, and configure your .env (read the README of the template you choose)

Usually, you'll need at minimum a `.env` file with your LLM's API key (OPENAI_API_KEY by default).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Adding Gemini to Your Project

With the recent update, our project now includes support for Gemini, a powerful tool from Google for generative AI tasks. To ensure your project can utilize Gemini, you need to add the `@google/generative-ai` dependency to your project.

### Installing Gemini Dependency

If you're setting up a new project or updating an existing one, make sure to include the Gemini dependency by running:

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

This command adds the `@google/generative-ai` package to your project, enabling you to leverage Google's generative AI capabilities alongside OpenAI's models.

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your agent will now:

1. Receive the user's question
2. Decide to use the getWeather action or leverage Gemini's capabilities
3. Execute the action
4. Provide a response
