## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

## Choose a template, and configure your .env

Read the README of the template you chose for a full list of env variables to setup

Usually you'll need at minimum a `.env` file with your LLM's api key. All templates use OpenAI by default, but you can change the provider to your preferried LLM.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```
