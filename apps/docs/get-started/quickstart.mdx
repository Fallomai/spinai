## Create a New Project

Use our CLI to create a new SpinAI project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

## Install Required Dependencies

After creating your project, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages, including the newly added `@google/generative-ai` package for integrating Google's Gemini model, along with other dependencies such as `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and `openai`.

## Configure Your .env File

Usually, you'll need at minimum a `.env` file with your LLM's API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` by default) and any other necessary environment variables specific to the AI models you're integrating.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

Ensure you replace `your_openai_api_key_here` and `your_google_ai_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

## Run Your Agent

Start your agent:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your agent will now:

1. Receive the user's question.
2. Decide to use the appropriate action based on the configured AI model.
3. Execute the action.
4. Provide a response.
