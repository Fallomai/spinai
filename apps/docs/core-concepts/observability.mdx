SpinAI provides built-in observability features to help you monitor and debug your AI agents. By enabling logging, you can track agent interactions, performance metrics, and costs in real-time through the SpinAI dashboard.

## Getting Started

To enable observability for your agents:

1. Sign in to [app.spinai.dev](https://app.spinai.dev)
2. Create an organization
3. Generate a SpinAI API key

Then, configure your agent with the API key and a unique agent ID:

```typescript
const agent = createAgent({
  instructions: "You are a customer support agent.",
  actions: [getCustomerInfo, getSubscriptionStatus, createTicket],
  model,
  // Enable observability with these two fields:
  agentId: "customer-support-agent", // Choose any unique identifier
  spinApiKey: process.env.SPINAI_API_KEY,
});
```

## What's Being Tracked

When observability is enabled, SpinAI automatically tracks:

- Agent interactions and their outcomes
- Model usage and token consumption
- Cost metrics per interaction
- Response times and latency
- Evaluation steps and reasoning
- Action executions and their results
- Errors and failure cases

## Viewing Logs

Visit [app.spinai.dev](https://app.spinai.dev) to view your agent logs and metrics. The dashboard provides:

- Real-time monitoring of agent activities
- Detailed interaction histories
- Cost and performance analytics
- Error tracking and debugging tools

All interactions are grouped by agent ID, making it easy to monitor specific agents or use cases within your application.
