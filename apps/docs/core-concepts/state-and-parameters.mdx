SpinAI allows you to store and use information in actions using the `context.state` object.

## State vs Parameters

#### State

State is a persistent object that:

- Can only be modified by your Actions
- Can have a default value that you pass in when you start the interaction
- Persists between action calls
- Useful for tracking progress or storing computation results
- Can be accessed via `context.state` in any action
- Can be accessed via `context.state` after an interaction is complete

Here's how to work with state in an example action:

```typescript
  async run(context, parameters) {
    const { a, b } = parameters;
    // Update state with result
    const result = a + b;
    context.state.result = result;
    return context;
  },
```

You can also access any variable stored in state at runtime after your agent has completed running:

```typescript
const { response, state } = await agent({
  input: "Create a ticket for my broken laptop",
  state: {},
});

console.log({ state }); // whatever you added to state in your actions
// will be accessible here after the agent runs
```

#### Parameters

Parameters are values that your agent passes into actions. They are:

- Dynamically determined by the LLM during the task loop
- Based on the action's parameter schema
- Derived from previous action results and current state
- Best for handling dynamic, per-action inputs

```typescript
// Example parameter schema
parameters: {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    a: { type: "number", description: "First number" },
    b: { type: "number", description: "Second number" },
  },
  required: ["a", "b"],
}
```

SpinAI's task loop follows a two-step decision process:

1. **Action Selection**

   - First, the LLM decides which action(s) to run based on the current context and goal
   - This decision is made using the action's description, the current state, and the user's input

2. **Parameter Determination**
   - Before executing the chosen action, SpinAI makes a separate decision to determine the exact parameters
   - Parameters are intelligently derived from:
     - Results of previously run actions
     - Current application state
     - User's original input
     - Any other available context

For example, in a calculator agent:

```typescript
// For the input "what is 5 plus 3 minus 1?"
// First action: sum is selected
const sumResult = await sum.run(context, {
  a: 5, // Agent decides to pass this in from user input
  b: 3, // Agent decides to pass this in from user input
});
// Result: 8 stored in state

// Second action: minus is selected
const minusResult = await minus.run(context, {
  a: 8, // Agent decides to pass this in from previous sum result
  b: 1, // Agent decides to pass this in from user input
});
// Final result: 7
```

## Best Practices

1. **Parameters**

   - Use for operation-specific inputs that the LLM can decide on what to pass in
   - Keep schemas simple and well-documented
   - Always include parameter descriptions
   - Mark truly required fields as required

2. **State**
   - Initialize your agent's interaction with default state variables if needed
   - Use for persistent data across actions that won't change (i.e customer emails, and other static data)
   - Keep state structure consistent
