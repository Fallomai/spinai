**Agents** are the core building blocks of SpinAI. They combine your chosen LLM with actions to solve tasks the way a human decision maker would.

They control what actions to call, what parameters to pass into those actions, all while maintaining state between them and keeping track of the execution history.

### Creating an agent

To create an agent, use the `createAgent` function with any of the [models supported by Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction). Note the model will automatically read your local `.env` file to authenticate itself.

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "spinai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const calculatorAgent = createAgent({
  instructions: `You are a calculator agent.`,
  actions: [sum, minus],
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});
```

### Agent Creation Parameters

| Parameter               | Type              | Required | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `instructions`          | `string`          | Yes      | Agent description and task                                                              |
| `model`                 | `LanguageModelV1` | Yes      | LLM to use for decision making                                                          |
| `actions`               | `Action[]`        | Yes      | Actions the agent can execute                                                           |
| `agentId`               | `string`          | No       | Agent identifier for logging (if using [SpinAI's log tracking](https://app.spinai.dev)) |
| `spinApiKey`            | `string`          | No       | SpinAI API key for logging (if using [SpinAI's log tracking](https://app.spinai.dev))   |
| `customLoggingEndpoint` | `string`          | No       | Custom logging endpoint for metrics                                                     |

## Calling your agent

To call an agent, it's as simple as using it as a function while passing an object in.

```tsx
const { response } = await calculatorAgent({
  input: "What is 5 plus 3 - 1?",
});
```

#### Calling your agent with a custom response format

You can also call your agent with a custom response format by passing in a Zod object.

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

const responseSchema = z.object({
  finalNumber: z.number(),
});

const { response } = await calculatorAgent({
  input: "What is 5 plus 3 - 1?",
  responseFormat: responseSchema,
});

console.log(response.finalNumber);
```

### Agent Run Parameters

Note: Some parameters are the same as the [agent creation parameters](#agent-creation-parameters), but they can also be passed when calling the agent. Any duplicate parameters passed in to the agent run call will override the ones passed in to the agent creation. This allows you to be flexible with things like using different LLM models, and actions, for an existing agent at different times.
