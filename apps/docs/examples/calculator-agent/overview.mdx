## Overview

A simple calculator agent that demonstrates core SpinAI concepts. The agent:

- Processes mathematical expressions in natural language
- Dynamically chooses between addition and subtraction operations
- Returns numerical results

## Structure

```bash
src/
├── actions/
│   ├── sum.ts     # Addition operation
│   └── minus.ts   # Subtraction operation
└── index.ts       # Main agent setup
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a new project:

```bash
npx create-spinai
```

2. Select the default template

3. Set up your environment:

```bash
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## How It Works

1. **Agent Setup**: Uses OpenAI (swappable with [any supported LLM](/llms/overview)) for decision making
2. **Available Actions**:
   - `sum`: Adds two numbers
   - `minus`: Subtracts two numbers
3. **Input Processing**: Converts natural language (e.g. "What is 5 plus 3 - 1?") into mathematical operations
4. **State Management**: Tracks calculation progress through multiple operations

## Example Usage

```typescript
const calculatorAgent = createAgent({
  instructions: `You are a calculator agent that helps users perform mathematical calculations.`,
  actions: [sum, minus],
  llm,
});

// Example: "What is 5 plus 3 minus 1?"
const { response } = await calculatorAgent({
  input: "What is 5 plus 3 minus 1?",
  state: {},
});
```

## Next Steps

Here are some easy things you can add to get your hands dirty and learn how Spin works

- Add a multiply action
- Add a division action
- Try to use the state returned by the agent call to keep a running sum that you can continue performing mathematical operations on, like a real calculator
- Add any agentId (i.e "calculator-agent") and your SpinAPI key to the createAgent parameters and track your model on [our dashboard](https://app.spinai.dev).

This example serves as a basic introduction to Spin's framework.
